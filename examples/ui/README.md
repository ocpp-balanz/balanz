# UI Examples

This directory hold two simplistic example UIs. The first `balanz-status.html` will display an ASCII tree representing all groups, chargers,
as well as ongoing and historic charging sessions.

The other, `balanz-control.html` adds - again simplistic - options for calling the `balanz` API. For details on these calls, please refer
to the `api.py` source code.

A prober graphical UI should of course be built, but there are only 24 hours in a day!
